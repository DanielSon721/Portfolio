              Hi, I'm Daniel. I am a Korean-American from Massachusetts,
              attending the University of Maryland. I am a Computer Science and
              Mathematics double major, entering my third undergraduate year.
              <br /><br />
              I have been coding for a long time, starting with basic block
              coding on Scratch with my best friend in 5th grade. I took all of
              the computer science courses offered at my high school, learning
              foundational skills such as HTML, Python, Java, OOP design, and
              more. I even earned a 5 on my AP Computer Science A exam!
              <br /><br />
              I decided to continue my pursuit of computer science at UMD with a
              focus on cybersecurity.
              <br /><br />
              At UMD I am part of the Sigma Phi Delta Engineering Fraternity
              where I serve as the treasurer of the executive board. Being
              treasurer has taught me many invaluable skills such as teamwork,
              communication, and leadership.
              <br /><br />
              I am also part of the App Development Club where I serve as a
              DevOps Engineer for the Children's National Hospital project. Our
              product is a MRI scan analysis web application that harnesses
              machine learning to give unique insights into scans of the brain,
              revealing tumors and other anomalies.
              <br /><br />
              The University of Maryland and SigPhi are my happy places, and I
              love all of my friends and acquaintances who make every day worth
              it :D
