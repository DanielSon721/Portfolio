Let me preface documentation this with the fact that <ins>I know absolutely nothing about frontend development</ins>. This portfolio was made 100% by me prompt engineering ChatGPT 4o.

While making this project, although I did learn a little about the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, the main bulk of what I learned from making this portfolio was prompt engineering. While yes, I did not write any of this code myself, that doesn't mean that I still put in a lot of time and effort into this portfolio.

First, I needed to conceive the portfolio in my mind. I needed a vision. Once I had my vision, I told ChatGPT what to do.

> Make me a portfolio website with a matrix rain background

> Add a black box containing sections: "My Toolkit", "Certifications", and "Projects"

> Add a menu bar at the top containing buttons: "About Me", "Writing Samples", "Projects"

One step at a time, I built the skeleton of my portfolio. And let me get one thing straight, _**A.I. never gets it right on the first try**_. I had to constantly prompt engineer ChatGPT to get it to make my portfolio the way I had envisioned it.

> Make it so "My Toolkit" and "Certifications" are in a column taking up the left 1/3 of the box, and have the "Projects" section take up the right 2/3

> Change the menu buttons to be a little smaller

> Add glow to the button text

I kept up this process for hours. Adding a new component to the portfolio, then editing it over and over and over until it was just right.

I of course had to go in and manually type in the content of the portfolio, but that was easy. Anyone can replace text in HTML code with their own words. But the difficult work had been done. 1500+ lines of HTML, CSS, and Javascript were written, bringing my vision into reality. And the best part? I put in minimal effort.

And that's why harnessing A.I. and prompt engineering is one of, if not the most important skill one can have in 2025 and the foreseeable future. Any ordinary person can make any extraordinary thing, quickly and easily.
